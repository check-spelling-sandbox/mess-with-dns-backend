# Mess With DNS

This is a snapshot of [Mess With DNS](https://messwithdns.net/)'s backend code from around when it was released. This snapshot won't be updated or maintained, and it's not really designed for anyone else but me to use -- there are a lot of hardcoded constants. It's just here in case people are interested in seeing how it works. There's no license.

### bug reports welcome

You can report issues you run into with Mess With DNS here, even if they're to do with the frontend.
